I will provide you a transcript of an audio note of a single person sharing an idea. I want to publish this idea on medium. I have cleaned it of any filler words already and now I want to analyze and parse it before handing it off to another LLM to formulate a blog post in my personal style

Here is how I want you to parse it:

First,

- How many central ideas are in this text ?

- Do all ideas relate to the same underlying problem? If not, separate the sentences from the text according to their ideas â€” mention those that seem to relate to several.

Then,

- what is/are the central idea(s)/question/problem/challenges of this transcript

- Finally, state them again in a readable fashion with quotes of the original verbatim message

Here is the text I want you to parse:
[insert the cleaned transcript generated from the previous step]
